## Wireshark Wiki:

**Wireshark is the world’s most widely-used open-source network protocol analyzer. It captures network traffic in real-time, enabling in-depth analysis and troubleshooting of complex network issues**. Wireshark supports hundreds of protocols and is 
highly valuable for network administrators, security analysts, and developers. The tool is widely used for tasks like monitoring network performance, diagnosing network issues, and inspecting security breaches.

**Wireshark is written in C and C++ and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPLv2), making it free to use and contribute to by the open-source community**.

**Wireshark provides cross-platform support, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be integrated with other tools like tshark (`the terminal-based version`), tcpdump, and nmap for extended capabilities**. Wireshark’s built-in filters allow users to pinpoint specific data packets, while its intuitive GUI provides a user-friendly experience for analyzing network data, regardless of the user's skill level.


## Security & Compliance:

- ***Packet Inspection*** - Wireshark allows deep packet inspection to identify network issues and potential security threats, offering compliance support for monitoring and securing sensitive data.

- ***Encryption Support*** - It can analyze encrypted traffic, provided the correct decryption keys are available, ensuring data protection in encrypted communications.

- ***Audit Logging*** - Captured data can be exported into various formats like (`CSV`), (`XML`), and (`JSON`), which can be used for logging, auditing, or compliance checks.

- ***Role-based Security*** - Network administrators can use Wireshark’s filters and user configurations to restrict access to sensitive network data during analysis, aligning with GDPR and HIPAA requirements.

## Important Note:
(`Do NOT`) use Wireshark on a network unless you have explicit permission, as capturing and inspecting traffic can violate privacy and legal regulations. Always ensure that all network captures are conducted in accordance with legal policies and company guidelines.


## Key Features:

- ***Protocol Analysis*** - Supports more than 1,000 network protocols and provides detailed insights into captured traffic for debugging and optimization.

- ***Real-time Traffic Monitoring*** - Captures live data directly from the network interface or reads from previously recorded pcap files.

- ***Custom Filters*** - Allows advanced filtering options to focus on specific packets or traffic patterns, making it easier to analyze complex networks.

- ***Cross-Platform*** - Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix systems, supporting a wide range of operating environments.

- ***Decryption*** - Wireshark can decrypt SSL/TLS traffic when the correct keys are available, enhancing security analysis.

- ***Extensible*** - Wireshark can be extended through plugins and Lua scripts, enabling customization for specific use cases.


## Best Practices:

- ***Network Permissions*** - Always ensure you have legal permission to capture network traffic and that monitoring adheres to your organization's security policies.

- ***Filter First*** - Use display filters during capture to focus on relevant traffic, reducing the size of the capture file and avoiding unnecessary data collection.

- ***Decryption*** - Securely manage decryption keys when analyzing encrypted traffic. Avoid storing sensitive keys in insecure locations.

- ***Regular Updates*** - Keep Wireshark up to date to benefit from the latest protocol updates and security patches.

- ***Capture Limitations*** - Avoid capturing on networks with excessive traffic for long durations to prevent performance degradation or storage issues.


##
> Wireshark’s ability to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic (when the correct keys are provided) is one of its standout features. It enables security analysts to inspect encrypted sessions in real-time, making it a powerful tool for identifying vulnerabilities, understanding network behavior, and ensuring secure communications without the need for costly, proprietary decryption tools.
